In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the
Wedding rings there on display
She smiles and nods her head
As he says, "Honey that's for you
It's not much but it's the best that I can do"

Golden ring (golden ring)
With one tiny little stone
Waiting there (waiting there)
For someone to take it home
By itself (by itself)
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a little wedding chapel
Later on that afternoon
An old upright piano
Plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, "With this ring I thee wed"

Golden ring (golden ring)
With one tiny little stone
Shining ring (shining ring)
Now at last it's found a home
By itself (by itself)
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a small two room apartment
As they fight their final round
He says, "You won't admit it
But I know you're leavin' town"
She says, "One thing's for certain
I don't love you anymore"
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door

Golden ring (golden ring)
With one tiny little stone
Cast aside (cast aside)
Like the love that's dead and gone
By itself (by itself)
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the
Wedding rings there on display

Golden ring
